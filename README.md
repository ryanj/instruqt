# OpenShift Labs on Instruqt

Welcome to the OpenShift Labs on Instruqt repositories. This repo is the source code of labs you find at https://play.instruqt.com/openshift

Please refer to the [Instruqt Documentation](https://docs.instruqt.com/) to understand how it works.

## Dependencies

#### Instruqt CLI

The first thing to do is to download the [Instruqt CLI](https://docs.instruqt.com/reference/software-development-kit-sdk)

#### yq

The `yq` command line tool will also be needed.

#### Instruqt branch management scripts

Download a zip file that contains three bash scripts and install them somewhere that is accessible via your `$PATH`:
https://docs.instruqt.com/how-to-guides/build-tracks/maintain-a-developer-workflow#bash-scripts

## Login

If don't have an account on Instruqt, create a new account: https://play.instruqt.com/login

Login with the CLI:

```
instruqt auth login
```

This will open a browser where you can login, then your CLI session is authenticated.

## Track Development

You can create a new track in general with this command:

### Track Create

Create an empty track:
```
instruqt track create --title "First track"
```

Use commands below to create a new track starting from a template OpenShift track


#### OpenShift track example

This creates an example track using CRC 4.9 VM with `root` user and authenticated by default with `system:admin` as in [this example](https://github.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/tree/master/examples/openshift-example-track):

```
instruqt track create --from openshift/openshift-example-track --title "My First OpenShift Track"
```

#### OpenShift track with Fedora sidecar example

This creates an example track using CRC 4.9 VM and a sidecar Fedora container using `root` user where to install packages/dependencies.
The container can be connected to the CRC VM with the oc CLI as in [this example](https://github.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/tree/master/examples/openshift-example-track-with-fedora-sidecar):

```
instruqt track create --from openshift/openshift-example-track-with-fedora-sidecar --title "My First OpenShift Track with Fedora Sidecar"
```


### Track Pull

You can download an existing track:

```
instruqt track pull openshift/operatorframework-k8s-api-fundamentals
```

### Track Push

You can push the change to your track in this way:

```
instruqt track push
```

### Logs

You can check the logs from your track in this way:

```
instruqt track logs
```

### Tips for katacoda's automatically converted context

#### Web Console

If Web Console access is required, replace Katacoda dynamic URLs with this snippet that will let user access to OpenShift from the web console by printing the HTTPS URL. The hypertext is highlighted so it's easy to access then by just clicking on it: 

```
    Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI:
    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```
    Copy the URL from the output of the above command and open it in your browser.
    We'll deploy our app as the `developer` user. Use the following credentials:
    * Username:
    ```
    developer
    ```
    * Password:
    ```
    developer
    ```
```

#### Routes

Replace Katacoda's dynamic URLs for routes with this snippet:

```
    Get the URL from command line, from *Terminal 1* run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    oc get route <route-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/taster"}{"\n"}'

    ```

    Copy the URL and open it in your browser, or click it from here.
```

#### Editor

Replace all text mentioning to "Click to open a file" with this snippet, just point the users to the Visual Editor tab containing a VSCode web editor:

```
    From the **Visual Editor** Tab, create a new file in this path: `fruit-taster/src/main/java/org/acme/Fruit.java`.
    Then add this code:
    ```java
    ...
    ```
    
    ```go
    ```
```

#### Code blocks

Instruqt doesn't have the click and execute feature, any code block is copy and paste.

Convert any block like this:

`oc get pods`

In this way:

```
oc get pods
```

#### Clean text

sometimes in the code you can find `&lt; &gt;` for `<>` or `&quote;` for `"`, please substitute it if you find it.

If you find this sequence
```
`
``
<br>
```

Replace with this regexp:

```
s/`\n\s+```\n\s+<br>//g
```

#### Assets

There's no relative path concept from assets like in Katacoda's index.json, so you need to download them from internet from the `setup-crc` or `setup-container` script and store in the expected path.

As a convention, we store files into track's `script` dir and images into track's `assets` dir:

```
├── assets
│   ├── images
│   │   └── ansible-op-flow.png
│   ├── podset_controller.go
│   └── podset_types.go
├── config.yml
├── scripts
│   ├── my_script.sh
├── step1
├── step2
├── step3
│   └── setup-container
├── step4
│   └── setup-container
├── step5
├── step6
│   └── setup-container
├── step7
├── track_scripts
│   ├── setup-container
│   └── setup-crc
└── track.yml
```

E.g. from `setup-crc`:

```
#!/bin/bash

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/operatorframework/go-operator-podset/assets/podset_types.go -o /tmp/podset_types.go
```



## CRC Image

We are currently using nested virtualization with a CRC 4.9 inside a RHEL 8 VM.

The setting to have this image is from the `config.yml` file:

```
version: "2"
virtualmachines:
- name: crc
  image: openshift-instruqt/openshift-instruqt-crc490-211026
  machine_type: n1-standard-8
  allow_external_ingress:
  - http
  - https
  - high-ports
```

We can also have a sidecar container that can connect to the CRC VM with oc CLI in this way:

```
version: "2"
containers:
- name: container
  image: fedora
  shell: /bin/bash
virtualmachines:
- name: crc
  image: openshift-instruqt/openshift-instruqt-crc490-211026
  machine_type: n1-standard-8
  allow_external_ingress:
  - http
  - https
  - high-ports
```

The connection is made inside the setup scripts like [this one](https://github.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/blob/master/operatorframework/go-operator-podset/track_scripts/setup-container). Please refer to Instruqt doc to understand [track's lifecycle scripts](https://docs.instruqt.com/tracks/lifecycle-scripts).

#### How we have skaffolded it

We used git submodules to clone this [repo](https://github.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/) and then we used this [script](https://gist.github.com/blues-man/d74b7aba058e62ba2e2042b4eb5d892c)

```bash
git submodule update --init
python kataklisma.py
```

For each generated directory representing the pathway->topic, inside subfolders with tracks:

```
instruqt track validate && instruqt track push
```

Bulk validate

```
for d in `ls -d */ | grep -v learn-katacoda`; do 
  echo $d;
  cd $d;
  for dd in `ls -d */`; do 
    echo $dd;
    cd $dd; 
    instruqt track validate; 
    cd ..; 
  done;
  cd ..; 
done 
```

Bulk validate and push

```
for d in `ls -d */ | grep -v learn-katacoda`; do 
  cd $d;
  echo $d;
  for dd in `ls -d */`; do 
    echo $dd;
    cd $dd; 
    instruqt track validate && instruqt track push --force;
    cd ..;
  done;
  cd ..; 
done

```
